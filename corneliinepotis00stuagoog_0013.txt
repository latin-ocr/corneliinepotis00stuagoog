ing to this view, it will be seen that we possess, exclusive of very

⁸ inconsiderable fragments, only the third book entire, portione ⁴

of the first and twelfth, and a Life of Atticus, to whom the
whole work was dedicated. The Life of Atticus was added alter
his death, and after the first publication of the work.

Nepos was not a man oi vast and comprehensive mind, like

Cicero or Caesan'hffle was evidently a man of rare culture, ¹

kindly beart, and genial disposition. A pure Latinity, an easy
eleganee, and an unaffeoted simplieity characterize and adom his
style. These qualities have made Nepos a favorite school-book

since 1471,the date of hisfirst modern publication. In that year .

uarto'volnme issued irom the prese oi Jenson, at Venice,

en· ed Aaou Proca n ves misum, mnasnng biogra- ³
phies of twenty distinguished commandens, three chapters ³

headed De Raphon, and biographies of Hamilcar and Han-

nibal. This edition wae followed hy several others, with the ⁴,
same general title, in all oi which Probus appeared to be the

author3 and it was not until 1569, that Dionysius Lambinus pub-

lished a carefully revised edition, and proved to the general
satisfactiones theylesrned that the whole work was the produc·

tion of Cornelius Nepos, and that Aemilius Probus had fraudu-

lently endeavored to palm it off as his own. The argument of 3
Lambinus is based chiefly on internal evidence, and his jndgment ³

has been renffirmed by thesoholars of more modern times. oom- 3
