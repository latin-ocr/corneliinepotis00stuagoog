LIFE OF NEPOS.

——oomoo—

CORNELIUS NEPOS was the contemporary and friend of
Cicero, Atticus, and Catullus. He was probably a native of
Verona, or of some neighboring village, and died during the reign
of Augustus. His praenomen is unknown. He filled none of the
higher offices cf government, but seems ιο have devoted himself
exclusively to a literary life, and to the society of that learned
circle which made the house of Atticus its centre. No other
particulare with regnrd to his personal history have been trane
mitted to us. He is known to have written the following works:
1. Chrombo. An Epitome of Universal History, in three books.
2. Exemplorum Inbri. This was probably a collection of remark·
able sayings and doings 3. De Iltaatrt'baa Virta. Gellius tellsus
an aneodote of Cato, adding, “ Scriptum est hoc in libro Cornelii
NepotisDeIllastre‘bas taran The first and second of these works
have perished. With regard ιο the third, various opinions have
been entertained By some it is regarded as ons of the lost works
of Nepos, and as forming no part of the work now known as Cor·
nelius Nepos. But that opinion now generally prevails which
regards the Dc ittonam Virta as by far the largest and most
important work of Nepos, of which only fragmentary portioris

e have come down to us; those portione, namely, which are included

in the present volume. This work contained in at least six-
teen books the lives of eminent men, arranged in classes, in
such a manner, that eminent foreigners of one class were pre·

ιι scnted in one book, and eminent Romans of the same class in the

following book. The arrangement was probably as follows:
L Da Regibus Entercram gentiam ΙΙ. De Regibus libatoriorum
ΙΙΙ. Da Excellentibaa Daribas Enteraram gentium IV. Da Excel-
lentibus Dasius Rornanorum ,· V. De Jora Cbasaltis orarem VI·
Dederis &aare Βοιοοοιοῑ VII. De Oratoribuo erwt VIII·
